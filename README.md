This repository has code to attempt to replicate and extend the results in Comparing Random Forest with Logistic Regression for Predicting Class-Imbalanced Civil War Onset Data by David Muchlinski, David Siroky, et. al., October 22, 2015

A complete report of our results is in `05_final_report.pdf`, which can be generated by cloning this repository and running `make` to execute the commands in the `Makefile` file. All data are in `data/` and any original source code provided by the authors is in `authors_original_code/`. We have also added an 06_Analysis_And_comparison.pdf and corresponding Rmd file where we make final comments and do a comparison between the models. Commands to generate these are included in the Makefile. Justification for this extra pdf is provided at the end of the Final_report

The repository is structured as follows:

1. `01_get_original_data.sh` gets the original data used by the authors and places a copy in `data/`
2. `02_clean_original_data.sh` cleans this data and saves the relevant dataframe(s) in `data/original_data_clean.Rdata`
3. `03_get_new_data.sh` gets new data used to extend the original results of this paper and places a copy in `data/`
4. `04_clean_new_data.sh` cleans this data and saves the relevant dataframe(s) in `data/new_data_clean.Rdata`
5. `05_final_report.Rmd` analysis both the original and new data to replicate and extend the results of the original paper, and produces the final report `05_final_report.pdf`
6. `06_Analysis_And_Comparison.Rmd` analysis both the original and new data to replicate and extend the results of the original paper, and produces the final report `06_Analysis_And_Comparison.pdf`
